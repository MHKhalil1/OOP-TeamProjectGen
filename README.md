## Description
This assignment was assigned by the Case-Western Coding Bootcamp. The intention with this assignment was too see where I've come with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). The task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
